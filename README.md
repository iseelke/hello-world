# hello-world

My name is Isaac Seelke
My main hobbies are basic otaku things, such as watching anime and reading manga. I also enjoy many outdoor activities, such as fishing and gardening.
I've recently started watching a lot of movies of various genres, and started an Excel file in order to track my progress.  I'm up to just over 1100 entries, and have watched over half. This is made easier by the fact that I watch movies at 2x speed by using an HTML editor extension.
